# Least-Squared-Polynomial

In this project, given N inputes (x_i, y_i) and a degree m, an estimated interpolation, using least squared methode and svd decomposition, a polynomial of degree m and the error will be given.
<!---  $\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left ( P_{n}\left ( x_{i} \right ) -y_{i}\right )^{2}$$\ -->
